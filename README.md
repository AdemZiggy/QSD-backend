During my internship, I had the opportunity to work on a challenging project called "QSDShop." I was responsible for backend development and had the privilege to collaborate with my colleague Kenan. Our mentor, Igor, provided us with valuable guidance and support throughout the project.

One of our main tasks was to create the database for "QSDShop." In collaboration with Kenan, we successfully designed and implemented a robust database that served as the foundation for the entire project. This involved structuring the data, establishing relational connections, and optimizing performance.

Afterward, my primary focus shifted towards developing endpoints related to user authentication, filters, product search, payment processing, and order creation. These endpoints were crucial for the functionality of "QSDShop," allowing users to easily browse products, apply filters based on various criteria, securely register and log in, and create orders with appropriate validations.

In parallel with endpoint development, I was responsible for implementing middleware that provided specific functionalities exclusively for administrators or super-administrators.

Throughout my work on the "QSDShop" project, I gained valuable insights into the dynamics of software development. Regular stand-up meetings allowed our team to synchronize, share progress, and tackle challenges effectively. We utilized the Trello tool to track our tasks, assigning unique IDs to facilitate progress monitoring and prioritize accordingly.

Through collaboration with Kenan and under Igor's mentorship, we successfully completed the tasks for the "QSDShop" project. In addition to technical growth, I acquired experience in teamwork, communication, and organization within a real-world environment. This project was both challenging and rewarding, as it provided an opportunity to enhance skills in database design, endpoint implementation, authentication, security, and task management tools.
